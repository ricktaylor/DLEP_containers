Several DLEP extensions are being suggested that require the ability to group a set of DLEP Data Items into a logical set or bag.
This document species a generic method of defining such a bag of Data Items, in what this document defines as a Data Item Container.
This document also describes what an extension using Data Item Containers must specify in the extension specification.
